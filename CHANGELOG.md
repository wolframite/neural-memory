# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Tag filtering in Query API and MCP** — `POST /query` accepts `tags: list[str]` (AND filter, max 20). `nmem_recall` accepts `tags: list[str]` to scope results to specific tag sets. Filters across `tags`, `auto_tags`, and `agent_tags` columns. Backward compatible — `tags=None` returns all results as before.

## [2.28.0] - 2026-03-08

### Added

- **`nmem_remember_batch`** — Bulk remember up to 20 memories in a single call. Partial success supported (individual failures don't block others). Added to `standard` tool tier.
- **Trust score** — First-class `trust_score` (0.0–1.0) and `source` fields on TypedMemory. Source-specific ceiling caps: `user_input=0.9`, `ai_inference=0.7`, `auto_capture=0.5`, `verified=1.0`. Schema v22 migration adds columns + index.
- **`min_trust` filter** — `nmem_recall` accepts optional `min_trust` parameter to filter out low-confidence memories.
- **Auto-promote context→fact** — Frequently-recalled context memories (frequency ≥ 5) are automatically promoted to `fact` during consolidation. Audit trail in metadata (`auto_promoted`, `promoted_from`, `promoted_at`).
- **SEMANTIC alternative path** — Memories can reach SEMANTIC stage via intensive reinforcement (`rehearsal_count ≥ 15` + `5 distinct 2h-windows`) as alternative to the 3-distinct-days spacing requirement. Enables agents with burst usage patterns.

### Fixed

- **FK constraint race condition** — `update_fiber()` no longer raises ValueError when a fiber is deleted between deferred-write enqueue and flush. Gracefully skips with debug log.

### Changed

- **MCP startup 3x faster** — Lazy-import `cli.setup` (defer until first-time init actually needed) and `sync.client`/`sync.sync_engine` (defer aiohttp until first sync call). Cold start: 611ms → 197ms.

## [2.27.3] - 2026-03-08

### Fixed

- **OpenAI-compatible client HTTP 400** — Tool schemas now include `parameters` alias alongside `inputSchema`, fixing "schema must be type object, got type None" errors when MCP tools are forwarded through OpenAI-compatible bridges (Cursor, LiteLLM, etc.)

### Added

- **Cognitive Reasoning Guide** — Full workflow documentation: hypothesize, evidence, predict, verify loop with Bayesian confidence formula, end-to-end examples (`docs/guides/cognitive-reasoning.md`)
- **Schema v21 Migration Guide** — New tables, auto-migration behavior, rollback instructions (`docs/guides/schema-v21-migration.md`)
- **Learning Habits Guide** — 3-stage pipeline, thresholds, confidence calculation, suggestion engine (`docs/guides/learning-habits.md`)
- **Pre-ship smoke tests** — Auto-type classifier (13 cases) and cognitive engine integration test in `scripts/pre_ship.py`

## [2.27.2] - 2026-03-07

### Fixed

- **OpenClaw plugin: lazy auto-connect** — Fixed tools returning "NeuralMemory service not running" when OpenClaw calls `register()` multiple times across subsystems (gateway, agent worker, CLI). Agent worker instance now lazily connects on first tool call via `ensureConnected()` with connection mutex to prevent race conditions (#38)

## [2.27.1] - 2026-03-06

### Added

- **`nmem_edit`** — Edit memory type, content, or priority by fiber ID. Preserves all neural connections. Supports typed_memory path (type/priority) and anchor neuron path (content update)
- **`nmem_forget`** — Soft delete (sets expires_at for natural decay) or hard delete (permanent removal with cascade to fiber + typed_memory). Also handles orphan neuron deletion
- **Enhanced MCP instructions** — Richer behavioral directives: brain growth tips, rich language patterns (causal/temporal/relational/decisional/comparative), memory correction guidance, all 38 tools listed
- **Enhanced plugin instructions** — Comprehensive agent guidance in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` for proactive memory usage

### Fixed

- **FK constraint errors** — `INSERT OR REPLACE INTO neuron_states` and `save_maturation` now catch `sqlite3.IntegrityError` when neuron was deleted by consolidation prune (previously crashed with FOREIGN KEY constraint failed)
- **Auto-type classifier bias** — Reordered `suggest_memory_type()`: DECISION now checked before INSIGHT to prevent "because" from hijacking decisions. Removed overly broad "because"/"pattern" from INSIGHT keywords. Added "rejected"/"went with" to DECISION, "prefers"/"preferred" to PREFERENCE. Tightened TODO keywords and added guard against descriptive "should"
- **DECISION_PATTERNS greediness** — Removed overly broad patterns (`"we're going to"`, `"let's use"`, `"going to"`) from `auto_capture.py` that caused false decision captures
- **Synapse FK error message** — Distinguished FOREIGN KEY violations from UNIQUE violations in `add_synapse()` for clearer error messages

- **Cognitive Reasoning Layer** — 8 new MCP tools for hypothesis-driven reasoning (38 tools total)
  - `nmem_hypothesize` — Create and manage hypotheses with Bayesian confidence tracking and auto-resolution
  - `nmem_evidence` — Submit evidence for/against hypotheses, auto-updates confidence via sigmoid-dampened shift
  - `nmem_predict` — Make falsifiable predictions with deadlines, linked to hypotheses via PREDICTED synapse
  - `nmem_verify` — Verify predictions as correct/wrong, propagates result to linked hypothesis
  - `nmem_cognitive` — Hot index: ranked summary of active hypotheses + pending predictions with calibration score
  - `nmem_gaps` — Knowledge gap metacognition: detect, track, prioritize, and resolve what the brain doesn't know
  - `nmem_schema` — Schema evolution: evolve hypotheses into new versions via SUPERSEDES synapse chain
  - `nmem_explain` — (moved to cognitive) Trace shortest path between concepts with evidence
- **Schema v21** — Three new tables: `cognitive_state` (hypothesis/prediction tracking), `hot_index` (ranked cognitive summary), `knowledge_gaps` (metacognition)
- **Pure cognitive engine** (`engine/cognitive.py`) — Stateless functions: `update_confidence`, `detect_auto_resolution`, `compute_calibration`, `score_hypothesis`, `score_prediction`, `gap_priority`
- **Bayesian confidence model** — Sigmoid-dampened shift with surprise factor and diminishing returns from total evidence
- **Auto-resolution** — Hypotheses with confidence ≥0.9 + 3 supporting evidence auto-confirm; ≤0.1 + 3 against auto-refute
- **Prediction calibration** — Tracks correct/wrong ratio across all resolved predictions
- **Schema version chain** — `parent_schema_id` column + `get_schema_history()` walks the SUPERSEDES chain with cycle guard
- **Knowledge gap detection sources** — `contradiction`, `low_confidence_hypothesis`, `user_flagged`, `recall_miss`, `stale_schema`

## [2.26.1] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- **Dashboard: actionable health penalties** — Top penalties section shows ranked cards with score bar, penalty points lost, estimated gain if fixed, and exact action to improve each component
- **API: `top_penalties` field** in `/api/dashboard/health` response — exposes diagnostics engine penalty analysis to frontend
- **i18n: penalty translations** — English and Vietnamese keys for top penalties section

## [2.26.0] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- **Brain Health Guide** (`docs/guides/brain-health.md`) — comprehensive guide explaining all 7 health metrics, thresholds, improvement roadmap (F through A), common issues, maintenance schedule
- **Connection Tracing docs** (`nmem_explain`) — added to README, MCP prompt, brain health guide. Previously undocumented feature that traces shortest path between concepts
- **Embedding auto-detection** (`provider = "auto"`) — automatically detects best available embedding provider: Ollama → sentence-transformers → Gemini → OpenAI. Lowers barrier for cross-language recall
- **Consolidation post-run hints** — warns about orphan neurons (>20%) and missing consolidation after running `nmem consolidate`
- **Pre-ship verification script** (`scripts/pre_ship.py`) — automated quality gate: version consistency, ruff, mypy, import smoke test, fast tests, plugin checks
- **MCP instructions update** — health interpretation, priority scale, tagging strategy, maintenance schedule added to system prompt

### Changed

- README: added nmem_explain to tools table, brain health section, connection tracing section, embedding auto-detect
- OpenClaw npm package renamed to `neuralmemory` (published on npm)

## [2.25.1] - 2026-03-05

### Fixed

- **`nmem flush` stdin blocking** — Process hangs forever when spawned as subprocess without piped input; `sys.stdin.read()` blocks because no EOF is sent. Added 5s timeout via `ThreadPoolExecutor` (fixes #27)
- **Consolidation prune** — Protects fiber members from orphan pruning + invariant tests
- **Orphan rate** — Counts fiber membership correctly, isolated E2E tests from production DB
- **Dashboard dist** — Bundled for `pip install` compatibility

### Changed

- Published v2.25.0 release (was stuck in draft)

## [OpenClaw Plugin 1.5.0] - 2026-03-05

### Fixed

- **Plugin ID mismatch warning** — Renamed package from `@neuralmemory/openclaw-plugin` to `neuralmemory` to match manifest `id`. OpenClaw's `deriveIdHint()` extracts the unscoped package name as `idHint`, which previously produced `openclaw-plugin` ≠ `neuralmemory`
- **Tool schema provider compatibility** — Replaced `integer` with `number` (Gemini rejects `integer`), added `additionalProperties: false` (OpenAI strict mode), removed constraint keywords (`maxLength`, `maxItems`, `minimum`, `maximum`) that some providers reject. MCP server validates these server-side
- **Pre-existing test bugs** — Config test missing `initTimeout` in expected defaults; execute tests passing args as `id` parameter

## [2.25.0] - 2026-03-04

### Added

- **Proactive Memory Auto-Save** — 4-layer system ensures agents use NeuralMemory without explicit instructions
  - **MCP `instructions`** — Behavioral directives in InitializeResult, auto-injected into agent context
  - **Post-tool passive capture** — Server-side auto-analysis of recall/context/recap/explain results with rate limiting (3/min)
  - **Plugin `instructions` field** — Short nudge for all plugin users
  - **Enhanced stop hook** — Transcript capture 80→150 lines, session summary extraction, always saves at least one context memory
- **Ollama embedding provider** — Local zero-cost inference via Ollama API (contributed by @xthanhn91)

### Fixed

- **Scale performance bottlenecks** — Consolidation prune, neuron dedup, cache improvements (PR #23)
- **OpenClaw plugin `execute()` signature** — Missing `id` parameter broke all agent tool calls (issue #19)
- **Auto-consolidation crash** — `ValueError: 'none' is not a valid ConsolidationStrategy` (issue #20)
- **`nmem remember --stdin`** — CLI now supports piped input for safe shell usage (issue #21)
- **CI test compatibility** — `test_remember_sensitive_content` mock fix for Python 3.11

### Added

- **Onboarding flow** — Detects fresh brain (0 neurons + 0 fibers) and surfaces a 4-step getting-started guide on the first tool call (`_remember`, `_recall`, `_context`, `_stats`). Shows once per server instance.
- **Background expiry cleanup** — Fire-and-forget task auto-deletes expired `TypedMemory` + underlying fibers on a configurable interval (default 12h, max 100/run). Fires `MEMORY_EXPIRED` hooks. Piggybacks on `_check_maintenance()`.
- **Scheduled consolidation** — Background `asyncio` loop runs consolidation every 24h (configurable strategies: prune, merge, enrich). Shares `_last_consolidation_at` with `MaintenanceHandler` to prevent overlap. Initial delay of one full interval avoids triggering on restart.
- **Version check handler** — Background task checks PyPI every 24h for newer versions of `neural-memory`. Caches result and surfaces `update_hint` in `_remember`, `_recall`, `_stats` responses when an update is available. Uses `urllib` (no extra deps), validates HTTPS scheme.
- **Expiry alerts** — `warn_expiry_days` parameter on `nmem_recall`; expiring-soon count in health pulse thresholds
- **Evolution dashboard** — `/api/evolution` REST endpoint + dashboard UI tab for brain maturation metrics (stage distribution, plasticity, proficiency)

### Changed

- **MaintenanceConfig** — Added 8 new config fields: `expiry_cleanup_enabled`, `expiry_cleanup_interval_hours`, `expiry_cleanup_max_per_run`, `scheduled_consolidation_enabled`, `scheduled_consolidation_interval_hours`, `scheduled_consolidation_strategies`, `version_check_enabled`, `version_check_interval_hours`
- **MCPServer mixin chain** — Added `OnboardingHandler`, `ExpiryCleanupHandler`, `ScheduledConsolidationHandler`, `VersionCheckHandler` mixins

## [2.4.0] - 2026-02-17

### Security

- **6-phase security audit** — Comprehensive audit across 142K LOC / 190 files covering engine, storage, server, config, MCP/CLI, core, safety, utils, sync, integration, and extraction modules
- **Path traversal fixes** — 3 CRITICAL path injection vulnerabilities in CLI commands (tools, brain import, shortcuts) patched with `resolve()` + `is_relative_to()`
- **CORS hardening** — Replaced wildcard patterns with explicit localhost origins in FastAPI server
- **TOML injection prevention** — Added `_sanitize_toml_str()` for user-provided dedup config fields
- **API key masking** — `BrainModeConfig.to_dict()` now serializes api_key as `"***"` instead of plaintext
- **Info leak prevention** — Removed internal IDs, adapter names, and filesystem paths from 5 error messages across MCP, integration, and sync modules
- **WebSocket validation** — Brain ID format + length validation on subscribe action
- **Path normalization** — `SQLiteStorage` and `NEURALMEMORY_DIR` env var paths now resolved with `Path.resolve()`

### Fixed

- **Frozen core models** — `Synapse`, `Fiber`, `NeuronState`, `BrainSnapshot`, `FreshnessResult`, `MemoryFreshnessReport`, `Entity`, `WeightedKeyword`, `TimeHint` dataclasses are now `frozen=True` per immutability contract
- **merge_brain() atomicity** — Restore from backup on import failure instead of leaving empty brain
- **import_brain() orphan** — Brain record INSERT moved inside transaction to prevent orphan on failure
- **Division-by-zero guards** — `_predicates_conflict()` and homeostatic normalization protected against empty inputs
- **Datetime hardening** — 4 `datetime.fromisoformat()` call sites wrapped with try/except + naive UTC enforcement
- **Lateral inhibition** — Ceiling division for fair slot allocation across clusters
- **suggest_memory_type** — Word boundary matching prevents false positives (e.g. "add" no longer matches "address")
- **Git update command** — Detects current branch instead of hardcoded 'main'
- **Dead code removal** — Removed unused `updated_at` field, duplicate index, stale imports

### Performance

- **N+1 query elimination** — `consolidation._prune()` pre-fetches neighbor synapses in batch (was 500+ serial queries); `activation.activate()` caches neighbors + batch state pre-fetch (was ~1000 queries); `conflict_detection` uses `asyncio.gather()` for parallel searches
- **Export safety caps** — `export_brain()` limited to 50K neurons, 100K synapses, 50K fibers
- **Bounds enforcement** — 15+ storage methods capped with `min(limit, MAX)`, schema tool limits enforced
- **Regex pre-compilation** — `sensitive.py` and `trigger_engine.py` patterns compiled at module level with cache
- **Enrichment optimization** — Early exit on empty tags + zero intersection in O(n^2) Jaccard loop
- **ReDoS prevention** — Content length cap (100K chars) before regex matching in sensitive content detection

### Changed

- **BrainConfig.with_updates()** — Replaced 80-line manual field copy with `dataclasses.replace()`
- **DriftReport.variants** — Changed from mutable `list` to `tuple` on frozen dataclass
- **Mutable constants** — `VI_PERSON_PREFIXES` and `LOCATION_INDICATORS` converted to `frozenset`
- **Error handling** — 8 bare `except Exception` blocks narrowed to specific exception types with logging

## [2.2.0] - 2026-02-13

### Added

- **Config presets** — Three built-in profiles: `safe-cost` (token-efficient), `balanced` (defaults), `max-recall` (maximum retention). CLI: `nmem config preset <name> [--list] [--dry-run]`
- **Consolidation delta report** — `run_with_delta()` wrapper computes before/after health snapshots around consolidation, showing purity, connectivity, and orphan rate changes. CLI consolidate now shows health delta.

### Fixed

- **CI lint parity** — CI now passes: fixed 14 lint errors in test files (unused imports, sorting, Yoda conditions)
- **Release workflow idempotency** — `gh release create` no longer fails when release already exists; uploads assets to existing release instead
- **CI test timeouts** — Added `pytest-timeout` (60s default) and `timeout-minutes: 15` to prevent stuck CI jobs

### Changed

- **Makefile** — Added `verify` target matching CI exactly (lint + format-check + typecheck + test-cov + security)
- **Auto-consolidation observability** — Background auto-consolidation now logs purity delta for monitoring

## [2.1.0] - 2026-02-13

### Fixed

- **Brain reset on config migration** — When upgrading to unified config (config.toml), `current_brain` is now migrated from legacy config.json so users don't lose their active brain selection
- **EternalHandler stale brain cache** — Eternal context now detects brain switches and re-creates the context instead of caching the initial brain ID indefinitely
- **Ruff lint errors** — Fixed 7 pre-existing lint violations (unused imports, naming convention, import ordering)
- **Mypy type errors** — Fixed 2 pre-existing type errors (`Any` import, `set()` arg-type)

### Added

- **CLI `--version` flag** — `nmem --version` / `nmem -V` now prints version and exits (standard CLI convention)
- **Actionable health scoring** — `nmem_health` now returns `top_penalties`: top 3 ranked penalty factors with estimated gain and suggested action
- **Semantic stage progress** — `nmem_evolution` now returns `stage_distribution` (fiber counts per maturation stage) and `closest_to_semantic` (top 3 EPISODIC fibers with progress % and next step)
- **Composable encoding pipeline** — Refactored monolithic `encode()` into 14 composable async pipeline steps (`PipelineContext` / `PipelineStep` / `Pipeline`)

### Changed

- **Dependency warning suppression** — pyvi/NumPy DeprecationWarnings are now suppressed at import time with targeted `filterwarnings`

## [2.3.1] - 2026-02-17

### Refactored

- **Engine cleanup** — Removed 176 lines of dead code across 6 engine modules
  - Deduplicated stop-word sets into shared `_STOP_WORDS` frozenset in `conflict_detection.py`
  - Replaced manual `Fiber()` constructor with `dc_replace()` in `consolidation.py`
  - Removed unused `reconstitute_answer()` from `retrieval_context.py`
  - Hoisted expansion suffix/prefix constants to module level in `retrieval.py`
  - Used `heapq.nlargest` instead of sorted+slice in retrieval reinforcement
  - Typed consolidation dispatch dict with `Callable[[], Awaitable[None]]` instead of `Any`

### Fixed

- **Unreachable break in dream** — Outer loop guard added to prevent quadratic blowup when activated neuron list is large (max 50K pairs)
- **JSON snapshot validation** — `brain_versioning.py` now validates parsed JSON is a dict before field access

## [2.3.0] - 2026-02-16

### Added

- **PreCompact + Stop auto-flush hooks** — Pre-compaction hook fires before context compression, parallel CI tests support
- **Emergency flush** (`nmem_auto action="flush"`) — Pre-compaction emergency capture that skips dedup, lowers confidence threshold to 0.5, enables all memory types regardless of config, and boosts priority +2. Tag `emergency_flush` applied to all captured memories. Inspired by OpenClaw Memory's Layer 3 (`memoryFlush`)
- **Session gap detection** — `nmem_session(action="get")` now returns `gap_detected: true` when content may have been lost between sessions (e.g. user ran `/new` without saving). Uses MD5 fingerprint stored on `session_set`/`session_end` to detect gaps from older code paths missing fingerprints
- **Auto-capture preference patterns** — Detects explicit preferences ("I prefer...", "always use..."), corrections ("that's wrong...", "actually, it should be..."), and Vietnamese equivalents. New memory type `preference` with 0.85 confidence
- **Windows surrogate crash fix** — MCP server now strips lone surrogate characters (U+D800-U+DFFF) from tool arguments before processing, preventing `UnicodeEncodeError` on Windows stdio pipes

### Fixed

- **CI lint failure** — Fixed ruff RUF002 (ambiguous EN DASH `–` in docstring) in `mcp/server.py`
- **CI stress test timeouts** — Skipped stress tests on GitHub runners to prevent CI timeout failures

### Changed

- **Release workflow hardened** — `release.yml` now validates tag version matches `pyproject.toml` + `__init__.py` before publishing, and runs full CI (lint + typecheck + test) as a gate before PyPI upload

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **Agent forgets tools after `/new`** — `before_agent_start` hook now always injects `systemPrompt` with tool instructions, ensuring the agent knows about NeuralMemory tools even after session reset. Previously only `prependContext` (data) was injected, leaving the agent unaware of available tools
- **Agent confuses CLI vs MCP tool calls** — `systemPrompt` injection explicitly states "call as tool, NOT CLI command", preventing agents from running `nmem remember` in terminal instead of calling the `nmem_remember` tool
- **`openclaw plugins list` not recognizing plugin on Windows** — Changed `main` and `openclaw.extensions` from TypeScript source (`src/index.ts`) to compiled output (`dist/index.js`). Added `prepublishOnly` and `postinstall` build scripts. Fixed `tsconfig.json` module resolution from `bundler` to `Node16` for broader compatibility
- **OpenClaw plugin ID mismatch** — Added explicit `"id": "neuralmemory"` to `openclaw` section in `package.json`, fixing the `plugin id mismatch (manifest uses "neuralmemory", entry hints "openclaw-plugin")` warning
- **Content-Length framing bug** — Switched from string-based buffer to raw `Buffer` for byte-accurate MCP message parsing. Fixes silent data corruption with non-ASCII content (Vietnamese, emoji, CJK)
- **Null dereference after close()** — `writeMessage()` and `notify()` now guard against null process reference
- **Unhandled tool call errors** — `callTool()` exceptions in tools.ts now caught and returned as structured error responses instead of crashing OpenClaw

### Added

- **Configurable MCP timeout** — New `timeout` plugin config option (default: 30s, max: 120s) for users on slow machines or first-time init
- **Actionable MCP error messages** — Initialize failures now include Python stderr output and specific hints:
  - `ENOENT` → tells user to check `pythonPath` in plugin config
  - Exit code 1 → suggests `pip install neural-memory`
  - Timeout → prints captured stderr + verify command (`python -m neural_memory.mcp`)

### Security

- **Least-privilege child env** — MCP subprocess now receives only whitelisted env vars (`PATH`, `HOME`, `PYTHONPATH`, `NEURALMEMORY_*`) instead of full `process.env`. Prevents leaking API keys and secrets to child process
- **Config validation** — `resolveConfig()` now validates types, ranges, and brain name pattern (`^[a-zA-Z0-9_\-.]{1,64}$`). Invalid values fall back to defaults instead of passing through
- **Input bounds on all tools** — Zod schemas now enforce max lengths: content (100K chars), query (10K), tags (50 items × 100 chars), expires_days (1–3650), context limit (1–200)
- **Buffer overflow protection** — 10 MB cap on stdio buffer; process killed if exceeded
- **Stderr cap** — Max 50 lines collected during init to prevent unbounded memory growth
- **Auto-capture truncation** — Agent messages truncated to 50K chars before sending to MCP
- **Graceful shutdown** — `close()` now removes listeners, waits up to 3s for exit, then escalates to SIGKILL
- **Config schema hardened** — Added `additionalProperties: false` and brain name `pattern` constraint

## [1.7.4] - 2026-02-11

### Fixed

- **Full mypy compliance**: Resolved all 341 mypy errors across 79 files (0 errors in 170 source files)
  - Added `TYPE_CHECKING` protocol stubs to all mixin classes (storage, MCP handlers)
  - Added generic type parameters to all bare `dict`/`list` annotations
  - Narrowed `str | None` → `str` before passing to typed parameters
  - Removed 14 stale `# type: ignore` comments
  - Added proper type annotations to `HybridStorage` factory delegate methods
  - Fixed variable name reuse across different types in same scope
  - Fixed missing `await` on coroutine calls in CLI commands

### Added

- **CLAUDE.md — Type Safety Rules**: New section documenting mixin protocol stubs, generic type params, Optional narrowing, and `# type: ignore` discipline to prevent future mypy regressions

## [1.7.3] - 2026-02-11

### Added

- **Bundled skills** — 3 Claude Code agent skills (memory-intake, memory-audit, memory-evolution) now ship inside the pip package under `src/neural_memory/skills/`
- **`nmem install-skills`** — new CLI command to install skills to `~/.claude/skills/`
  - `--list` shows available skills with descriptions
  - `--force` overwrites existing with latest version
  - Detects unchanged files (skip), changed files (report "update available"), missing `~/.claude/` (graceful error)
- **`nmem init --skip-skills`** — skills are now installed as part of `nmem init`; use `--skip-skills` to opt out
- Tests: 25 new unit tests for `setup_skills`, `_discover_bundled_skills`, `_classify_status`, `_extract_skill_description`

### Changed

- `_classify_status()` now recognizes "installed" and "updated" as success states
- `skills/README.md` updated: manual copy instructions replaced with `nmem install-skills`

## [1.7.2] - 2026-02-11

### Security

- **CORS hardening**: Default CORS origins changed from `["*"]` to `["http://localhost:*", "http://127.0.0.1:*"]` (C2)
- **Bind address**: Default server bind changed from `0.0.0.0` to `127.0.0.1` (C4)
- **Migration safety**: Non-benign migration errors now halt and raise instead of silently advancing schema version (C8)
- **Info leakage**: Removed available brain names from 404 error responses (H21)
- **URI validation**: Graphiti adapter validates `bolt://`/`bolt+s://` URI scheme before connecting (H23)
- **Error masking**: Exception type names no longer leaked in MCP training error responses (H27)
- **Import screening**: `RecordMapper.map_record()` now runs `check_sensitive_content()` before importing external records (H33)

### Fixed

- Fix `RuntimeError: Event loop is closed` from aiosqlite worker thread on CLI exit (Python 3.12+)
  - **Root cause**: 4 CLI commands (`decay`, `consolidate`, `export`, `import`) called `get_shared_storage()` directly, bypassing `_active_storages` tracking — aiosqlite connections were never closed before event loop teardown
  - Route all CLI storage creation through `get_storage()` in `_helpers.py` so connections are properly tracked and cleaned up
  - Add `await asyncio.sleep(0)` after storage cleanup to drain pending aiosqlite worker thread callbacks before `asyncio.run()` tears down the loop
- **Bounds hardening**: MCP `_habits` fiber fetch reduced 10K→1K; `_context` limit capped at 200; REST `list_neurons` capped at 1000; `EncodeRequest.content` max 100K chars (H11-H13, H32)
- **Data integrity**: `import_brain` wrapped in `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` with rollback on failure (H14)
- **Code quality**: AWF adapter gets ImportError guard; redundant `enable_auto_save()` removed from train handler (C7, H26)
- **Public API**: Added `current_brain_id` property to `NeuralStorage`, `SQLiteStorage`, `InMemoryStorage` — replaces private `_current_brain_id` access (H25)

### Added

- **CLAUDE.md**: Project-level AI coding standards (architecture, immutability, datetime, security, bounds, testing, error handling, naming conventions)
- **Quality gates**: Automated enforcement via ruff, mypy, pytest, and CI
  - 8 new ruff rule sets: S (bandit), A (builtins), DTZ (datetimez), T20 (print), PT (pytest), PERF (perflint), PIE, ERA (eradicate)
  - Per-file-ignores for intentional patterns (CLI print, simhash MD5, SQL column names, etc.)
  - Coverage threshold: 67% enforced in CI and Makefile
  - CI: typecheck job now fails build (removed `continue-on-error` and `|| true`); build requires `[lint, typecheck, test]`; added security scan job
  - Pre-commit: updated hooks (ruff v0.9.6, mypy v1.15.0); added `no-commit-to-branch` and `bandit`
  - Makefile: added `security`, `audit` targets; `check` now includes `security`

### Changed

  - **Expired Memory Hint** — Health pulse detects expired memories via cheap COUNT query on `typed_memories` table. Surfaces hint when count exceeds threshold (default: 10): `"N expired memories found. Consider cleanup via nmem list --expired."`
  - **Stale Fiber Detection** — Health pulse detects fibers with decayed conductivity (last conducted >90 days ago or never). Surfaces hint when stale ratio exceeds threshold (default: 30%): `"N% of fibers are stale. Consider running nmem_health for review."`
- **MaintenanceConfig extensions** — 3 new configuration fields:
  - `expired_memory_warn_threshold` (default: 10)
  - `stale_fiber_ratio_threshold` (default: 0.3)

- **Factual contradiction detection**: Regex-based extraction of `"X uses/chose/decided Y"` patterns, compares predicates across memories with matching subjects
- **Decision reversal detection**: Identifies when a new DECISION contradicts an existing one via tag overlap analysis
- **Dispute resolution pipeline**: Anti-Hebbian confidence reduction, `_disputed` and `_superseded` metadata markers, and CONTRADICTS synapse creation
- **Disputed neuron deprioritization**: Retrieval pipeline reduces activation of disputed neurons by 50% and superseded neurons by 75%

## [0.11.0] - 2026-02-07

### Added

- **Activation stabilization**: Iterative dampening algorithm settles neural activations into stable patterns after spreading activation — noise floor removal, dampening (0.85x), homeostatic normalization, convergence detection (typically 2-4 iterations)
- **Multi-neuron answer reconstruction**: Strategy-based answer synthesis replacing single-neuron `reconstitute_answer()` — SINGLE mode (high-confidence top neuron), FIBER_SUMMARY mode (best fiber summary), MULTI_NEURON mode (top-5 neurons ordered by fiber pathway position)
- **Memory maturation lifecycle**: Four-stage memory model STM → Working (30min) → Episodic (4h) → Semantic (7d + spacing effect). Stage-aware decay multipliers: STM 5x, Working 2x, Episodic 1x, Semantic 0.3x
- **Spacing effect requirement**: EPISODIC → SEMANTIC promotion requires reinforcement across 3+ distinct calendar days, modeling biological spaced repetition
- **Pattern extraction**: Episodic → semantic concept formation via tag Jaccard clustering (Union-Find). Clusters of 3+ similar fibers generate CONCEPT neurons with IS_A synapses to common entities
- **MATURE consolidation strategy**: New consolidation strategy that advances maturation stages and extracts semantic patterns from mature episodic memories
- `StabilizationConfig`, `StabilizationReport`, `stabilize()` in new `engine/stabilization.py`
- `SynthesisMethod`, `ReconstructionResult`, `reconstruct_answer()` in new `engine/reconstruction.py`
- `MemoryStage`, `MaturationRecord`, `compute_stage_transition()`, `get_decay_multiplier()` in new `engine/memory_stages.py`

- 49 new unit tests: stabilization (12), reconstruction (11), memory stages (16), pattern extraction (8), plus 2 consolidation tests

### Changed

- Retrieval pipeline inserts stabilization phase after lateral inhibition and before answer reconstruction
- Answer reconstruction uses multi-strategy `reconstruct_answer()` instead of `reconstitute_answer()`
- Encoder initializes maturation record (STM stage) when creating new fibers
- Consolidation engine supports `MATURE` strategy for stage advancement and pattern extraction

## [0.10.0] - 2026-02-07

### Added

- **Formal Hebbian learning rule**: Principled weight update `Δw = η_eff * pre * post * (w_max - w)` replacing ad-hoc `weight += delta + dormancy_bonus`
- **Novelty-adaptive learning rate**: New synapses learn ~4x faster, frequently reinforced synapses stabilize toward base rate via exponential decay
- **Natural weight saturation**: `(w_max - w)` term prevents runaway weight growth — weights near ceiling barely change
- **Competitive normalization**: `normalize_outgoing_weights()` caps total outgoing weight per neuron at budget (default 5.0), implementing winner-take-most competition
- **Anti-Hebbian update**: `anti_hebbian_update()` for conflict resolution weight reduction (used in Phase 3)
- `learning_rate`, `weight_normalization_budget`, `novelty_boost_max`, `novelty_decay_rate` on `BrainConfig`
- `LearningConfig`, `WeightUpdate`, `hebbian_update`, `compute_effective_rate`, `normalize_outgoing_weights` in new `engine/learning_rule.py`
- 33 new unit tests covering learning rule, normalization, and backward compatibility

### Changed

- `Synapse.reinforce()` accepts optional `pre_activation`, `post_activation`, `now` parameters — uses formal Hebbian rule when activations provided, falls back to direct delta for backward compatibility
- `ReflexPipeline._defer_co_activated()` passes neuron activation levels to Hebbian strengthening
- `ReflexPipeline._defer_reinforce_or_create()` forwards activation levels to `reinforce()`
- Removed dormancy bonus from `Synapse.reinforce()` (novelty adaptation in learning rule replaces it)

## [0.9.6] - 2026-02-07

### Added

- **Sigmoid activation function**: Neurons now use sigmoid gating (`1/(1+e^(-6(x-0.5)))`) instead of raw clamping, producing bio-realistic nonlinear activation curves
- **Firing threshold**: Neurons only propagate signals when activation meets threshold (default 0.3), filtering borderline noise
- **Refractory period**: Cooldown prevents same neuron firing twice within a query pipeline (default 500ms), checked during spreading activation
- **Lateral inhibition**: Top-K winner-take-most competition in retrieval pipeline — top 10 neurons survive unchanged, rest suppressed by 0.7x factor
- **Homeostatic target field**: Reserved `homeostatic_target` field on NeuronState for v2 adaptive regulation
- `fired` and `in_refractory` properties on `NeuronState`
- `sigmoid_steepness`, `default_firing_threshold`, `default_refractory_ms`, `lateral_inhibition_k`, `lateral_inhibition_factor` on `BrainConfig`
- Schema migration v5→v6: four new columns on `neuron_states` table

### Changed

- `NeuronState.activate()` applies sigmoid function and accepts `now` and `sigmoid_steepness` parameters
- `NeuronState.decay()` preserves all new fields (firing_threshold, refractory_until, refractory_period_ms, homeostatic_target)
- `DecayManager.apply_decay()` uses `state.decay()` instead of manual NeuronState construction
- `ReinforcementManager.reinforce()` directly sets activation level (bypasses sigmoid for reinforcement)
- Spreading activation skips neurons in refractory cooldown
- Storage layer (SQLite + SharedStore) serializes/deserializes all new NeuronState fields

## [0.9.5] - 2026-02-07

### Added

- **Type-aware decay rates**: Different memory types now decay at biologically-inspired rates (facts: 0.02/day, todos: 0.15/day). `DEFAULT_DECAY_RATES` dict and `get_decay_rate()` helper in `memory_types.py`
- **Retrieval score breakdown**: `ScoreBreakdown` dataclass exposes confidence components (base_activation, intersection_boost, freshness_boost, frequency_boost) in `RetrievalResult` and MCP `nmem_recall` response
- **SimHash near-duplicate detection**: 64-bit locality-sensitive hashing via `utils/simhash.py`. New `content_hash` field on `Neuron` model. Encoder and auto-capture use SimHash to catch paraphrased duplicates
- **Point-in-time temporal queries**: `valid_at` parameter on `nmem_recall` filters fibers by temporal validity window (`time_start <= valid_at <= time_end`)
- Schema migration v4→v5: `content_hash INTEGER` column on neurons table

### Changed

- `DecayManager.apply_decay()` now uses per-neuron `state.decay_rate` instead of global rate
- `reconstitute_answer()` returns `ScoreBreakdown` as third tuple element
- `_remember()` MCP handler sets type-specific decay rates on neuron states after encoding

## [0.9.4] - 2026-02-07

- **Batch storage methods**: `get_synapses_for_neurons()`, `find_fibers_batch()`, `get_neuron_states_batch()` — single `IN()` queries replacing N sequential calls
- **Deferred write queue**: Fiber conductivity, Hebbian strengthening, and synapse writes batched after response assembly
- **Parallel anchor finding**: Entity + keyword lookups via `asyncio.gather()` instead of sequential loops
- **Batch fiber discovery**: Single junction-table query replaces 5-15 sequential `find_fibers()` calls
- **Batch subgraph extraction**: Single query replaces 20-50 sequential `get_synapses()` calls
- **BFS state prefetch**: Batch `get_neuron_states_batch()` per hop instead of individual lookups
- Target: 3-5x faster retrieval (800-4500ms → 200-800ms)
